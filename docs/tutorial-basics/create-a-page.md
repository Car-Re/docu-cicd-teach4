# Create your first Markdown Page

Create a new file at `src/pages`:

```mdx title="src/pages/my-markdown-page.md"
# My First Markdown page

This is a Markdown page
```

:::info[Reminder]

The `#` stands for header, as we learned in [Introduction to Markdown](../md_intro.md).

:::

After successful creation of file and committing the changes a new page will appear at 
`https://<my_git_account>.github.io/docu-cicd-teach4/my-markdown-page`.
